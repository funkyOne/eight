### Reps, Sets, Rest, and Speed

The first step is understanding these terms and how they apply to your workout program. In brief, a rep means repetition, and references one complete movement. So, one bicep curl equals one rep, and 5 bicep curls are 5 reps. Reps make up a set, which is usually the total number of reps you'll do before taking a break. You'll find more detail on sets, reps, rest, and speed below.

### Reps

A repetition (rep) is one completion of an exercise, such as one deadlift, one bench press, or one arm curl. A repetition maximum (1RM) is your personal best, or the most you can lift once in a single repetition of an exercise. Therefore, a 12RM is the most you can lift and successfully perform 12 repetitions with proper form. As with any rep-based weight lifting exercise, be sure to improve your grip by using a quality lifting chalk.

### Sets

A set is a series of repetitions performed sequentially. For example, eight repetitions can be one set of bench presses.

### Rest

The rest interval is the time spent resting between sets that allow the muscle to recover.
